[H[2J[question] : distinct - when alias is active ?
[answer] must use eval to activating the new aliases
[type] seems to use eval.. because it is aware of the alias

test11
set is aliased to `aliased'
set hello
test12
set is aliased to `aliased'
set hello
test21
eval set hello
[ aliased ] hello
test22
eval set hello
[ aliased ] hello
